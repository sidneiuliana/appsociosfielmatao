The provided trajectory details the initial prompt and comprehensive guidelines given to an AI engineer for developing a full-stack application. The core task is to build a product management application with product registration (name, value, QR code), ticket printing, and stock control linked to ticket redemption. The AI engineer's environment is a Kubernetes container, utilizing React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Crucially, the AI engineer is instructed to prioritize delivering an aha moment by focusing on core features rapidly, adhering to strict UI/UX guidelines, and following specific rules for environment variables, API routing ( prefix), and third-party integrations via . The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer being tasked to create a detailed step-by-step plan, indicating that actual development work has not yet commenced.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an application for product management with the following core functionalities:
1.  **Product Registration:** Ability to register new products, including:
    *   Product Name
    *   Product Value
    *   Associated QR Code for each product.
2.  **Ticket Printing:** Functionality to select a product and specify the desired number of tickets to print for that product.
3.  **Stock Control:** Implementation of an inventory management system to track product stock.
4.  **Ticket Redemption/Deduction:** Mechanism to decrease product stock when a previously printed ticket is redeemed or baixa.

The previous AI engineer was tasked with building an MVP rapidly, focusing on max value features, and was instructed to produce a detailed step-by-step plan before proceeding with implementation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React Frontend, FastAPI Backend, MongoDB Database.
-   **Containerization:** Kubernetes environment.
-   **UI/UX:** Shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS, specific modern design guidelines (e.g., no default colors, specific fonts, micro-animations).
-   **API Communication:** Frontend uses  with  prefix for backend; Backend uses .
-   **Service Management:** Supervisor for managing frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8001) services.
-   **Data Handling:** UUIDs for IDs instead of MongoDB ObjectIDs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with separate directories for frontend, backend, tests, and scripts.



**Detailed Directory Structure and File Importance:**

-   **/app/backend/:** Contains the FastAPI backend application.
    -   : Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   : The main FastAPI application file, containing API endpoints and logic.
    -   : Stores backend environment variables, specifically  for database connection.
-   **/app/frontend/:** Houses the React frontend application.
    -   : Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts for the frontend.
    -   : Configures Tailwind CSS for styling.
    -   : PostCSS configuration, likely for Tailwind processing.
    -   : Stores frontend environment variables, notably  for API calls.
    -   : Directory for static assets.
    -   : Contains the React source code.
        -   : The entry point for the React application.
        -   : The main React component where application UI will be rendered.
        -   : Component-specific styles (though Tailwind is preferred).
        -   : Global styles, including Tailwind base, components, and utilities imports, and custom CSS variables for themes.
        -   : Contains pre-built Shadcn/ui components (e.g., , , ), which are mandated for use.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Develop a detailed, step-by-step plan for implementing the product registration, ticket printing, stock control, and ticket redemption functionalities.
-   Implement the FastAPI backend with MongoDB models and CRUD endpoints for products and tickets.
-   Develop the React frontend UI for product management and ticket operations.
-   Integrate frontend and backend ensuring correct API routing and environment variable usage.
-   Generate QR codes for products and integrate with the printing functionality.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has not yet commenced actual code implementation. The current state of work is at the initial planning and understanding phase. The engineer has thoroughly reviewed the user's explicit product requirements, environmental constraints (Kubernetes, supervisor, hot reload), architectural setup (React, FastAPI, MongoDB), and strict development guidelines (UI/UX, environment variables, third-party integrations). The immediate next action required from the AI engineer, as per the trajectory, is to formulate a comprehensive step-by-step execution plan for the project. No files have been modified or created beyond their initial, pre-provided states as described in the Initial Project Structure section of the prompt.
